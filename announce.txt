The following package has been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* biber-2.7-1

Biber is a BibTeX replacement for users of BibLaTeX.  Biber supports
full UTF-8, can (re-)encode input and output, supports highly
configurable sorting, dynamic bibliography sets, and many other
features.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.  It is marked as a
test release because it requires at least perl-5.24, which is
currently only available in Cygwin as a test release.

In addition, you will have to install the biber prerequisite
modules[1] using cpan, since these are not yet available for perl-5.24
in the Cygwin distribution.

Finally, biber-2.7 is designed to work with biblatex-3.7.  This will
be available shortly in a test release of
texlive-collection-bibtexextra.
