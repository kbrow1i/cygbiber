Subject: biber 2.9-1

The following package has been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* biber-2.9-1

Biber is a BibTeX replacement for users of BibLaTeX.  Biber supports
full UTF-8, can (re-)encode input and output, supports highly
configurable sorting, dynamic bibliography sets, and many other
features.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.  It is designed to
work with biblatex-3.9.  The latter is contained in
texlive-collection-bibtexextra, which has just been updated also.
